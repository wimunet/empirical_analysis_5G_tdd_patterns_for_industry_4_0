# empirical_analysis_5G_tdd_patterns_for_industry_4_0
We investigate the potential of configuring the 5G time division duplex pattern to minimize packet transmission delay in industrial environments. Through empirical measurements using a commercial 5G system, we evaluate different TDD configurations under varying traffic loads, packet sizes and full buffer status report activation.
